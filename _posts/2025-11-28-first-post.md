# Hello Internet!
I'm not entirely sure where I want to take this blog, but I've had these ideas for a while so I thought it'd be good to start it now. Most likely though, expect music/literature reviews and general yapping about a lot of different interesting subjects (in my judgement).

But first, who am I? You can call me liz, I'm a college sophomore studying Creative Writing and Translation in a Chinese university. I'm highly interested in sociolinguistics and the relationship between East Asian languages. I'm also interested in system administration and Linux cybersecurity. Hence, I might also post about interesting things I find in the FOSS and Linux world. I may also post some language learning posts including both general guides on how to learn languages and also language-specific grammar or vocabulary posts. I'm currently taking Korean in school so that might come up.

I also write lyric translations on lyricstranslate and would like to write about that process! I really enjoy writing singable translations for vocaloid and game OSTs. If any of this seems interesting to you, I hope you enjoy my blog! xx

What I've been listening to: **EDEN - Dark**
Best song: **TEAM**
